The Garden Party was a banquet held in the middle court. There was a crimson carpet laid out in the large gazebo. Long tables were lined up in two rows, where the seat of honour was established at the end.

The arrangement was that the emperor will sit on the seat of honour, with the empress dowager and the imperial brother on both his sides. The Noble Consort and the Able Consort will sit on the east side, and the Virtuous Consort and Pure Consort the west side. The current imperial brother from the same mother is currently first in the line of succession with the death of the crown prince.
Nevertheless, she could only think they were arranged like this to start a quarrel. It cannot be helped that the Four Madame’s hostility will be stirred up this way.

This imperial brother lives an obscure lifestyle in spite of his mother being the empress dowager.
He was to sit on the seat of honour, belying his public appearance, but it was empty. He rarely leaves his room due to his weak constitution and doesn’t perform his official duties either.
All sorts of speculation circulate about him. Some say the many years younger brother is pampered by the emperor. Otherwise, he is confined to his room. Or that he isn’t allowed to go outside, as the empress dowager is overly affectionate to him.

Well, it wasn’t something that concerned Maomao.

The dishes came out past noon. She was now enjoying acrobatics and dance performances.
Only the head maid Honnyan accompanied Consort Gyokuyou. As far as they were not needed, the other maids waited for instructions behind the curtain.

The princess was being rocked by the Empress Dowager. Her drifting elegance and her unfading beauty did not pale in comparison to the Four Consorts around her.

(They should prepare more cover(tent).)

Although it was a curtain, it was only good enough to give shade. It did nothing as a windbreaker.

Even Maomao and the others who had hand warmers thought it was cold. It must be unbearable for the other consorts and their maids.

As expected, the other backup maids were trembling, some of them were standing pigeon-toed. She thought that right now would be a good time to go to the privy, but considering the other consorts’ maids’ standpoints, they might not be able to go.

Worryingly, the Four Madames’ maids are wishing for a war by proxy for their masters.

The head maids, who had the position warn them against doing this were by their respective consorts’ sides. There was no one to stop them.

At present, the image of the dispute was “Consort Gyokuyou’s army vs. Consort Rifa’s army”, and “Pure Consort’s army vs. Virtuous Consort’s army”.
By the way, the whole army of Consort Gyokuyou’s military camp had four people; not even half of the maids on the other side. Though it was somewhat unfavourable, Infa tried her best.

“Hah, plain, you say? Are you stupid? What you call a maid is someone who serves a master, right? What’s the point of pointlessly dressing up?”

It seems they were having a dispute over clothing. The clothing of the maids on the other side, as they served Consort Rifa, were blue themed, with a shawl and lots of decoration. A whole lot gaudier compared to their own.

“What are you saying? Your master will have hardship if you look bad. I knew it. They can only employ that plain woman.”
